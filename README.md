# NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis

## Project Description:

This self-motivated project explores the 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data from New York City, aiming to uncover insights into taxi trip patterns, payments, and more. The dataset was obtained from the NYC Open Data program and provides a snapshot of taxi rides throughout the year.

## Dataset Information:
The dataset `2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv`, was gathered by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission and published by the city of New York as part of their NYC Open Data program. 
In order to improve the learning experience and shorten runtimes, a sample was drawn from the 113 million rows in the 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data table.
